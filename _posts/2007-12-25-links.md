Now that your ears are happy (happier at least? Well at least mine are), here's some cool stuff for your eyes.

These links will take you to interesting sites, worthwile downloads, or perhaps some of my own projects.

* [US Weather Radar](http://radar.weather.gov/Conus/full_loop.php) - Instant animated radar for the whole country

* [CrunchyRoll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/videos/anime) - Great place to watch current anime and some classics for free

* [My Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0Zrnt240qtqgGhOe) - Come play games with me!

* [Touch Piano](http://touchpianist.com/) - Play classical piano just by tapping the right rhythms

* [HexClock](http://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/) - Shows the time and a corresponding hex color

More coming soon!
