Having an **embedded media** (photos and video) is often inflexible with a dynamic and **responsive design**.

### Embed your video like this:
{: .left}

{% highlight html linenos=table %}
<div class="icontain">
  <iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/155044978&color=4B306A&theme_color=4B306A"></iframe>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

It'll play like this funny video below! Try resizing the page!

Photo layouts are also really cool and dynamically resizable. Check out the photos/gallery section at [magiciansanfrancisco.com](http://magiciansanfrancisco.com) for a demo and see [the source code](https://github.com/strongrobert/MagicianSanFrancisco) for how.

<div class="icontain"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8yis7GzlXNM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
