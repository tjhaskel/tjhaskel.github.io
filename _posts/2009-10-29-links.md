I think this site is pretty cool, but let's be honest. There are much cooler things to **see**{: .text-red} on the world-wide-web!

These links will take you to interesting sites, worthwile downloads, or perhaps some of my own projects.

* [Touch Piano](http://touchpianist.com/) - Play classical piano just by tapping the right rhythms

* [US Weather Radar](http://radar.weather.gov/Conus/full_loop.php) - Instant animated radar for the whole country

* [CrunchyRoll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/videos/anime) - Great place to watch current anime and some classics for free

* [Plink!](http://dinahmoelabs.com/#plink) - Make music with others. Super intuitive and entirely addictive

* [My Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0Zrnt240qtqJLfFC) - Discord is like a free mix of Teamspeak and IRC. Slack for gamers.
