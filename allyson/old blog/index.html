					<h4>September 25, 2013</h4>
					<p> As you may have noticed, those of you that have been with me from the beginning (mainly Trevan haha), I have made a few updates to my website! First off
					my navigation bar is a complete improvement! It used to just look like little links, but now it looks like real buttons! I also created a sidebar
					where I can eventually put up an archive of my blogs. I learned how to put up a background image. See the adorable picture of my dog, Haylie? 
					Well Trevan actually took that with a film camera. He's pretty decent at taking pictures. The shots would have been even more amazing if the lens 
					on the camera was better. One of my goals is to learn photography, use photoshop and then hopefully share my work on here. As for the website, I'd 
					like to integrate in a comment box and a real archive area for the blog. I also intend to learn some other coding languages to improve it overall.
					However I'm not exactly sure what else I can do with this website but I'd definitely keep working at it. I've already learned so much!

					<p>Hey guys! I'm just testing out how to use HTML5 from the book I'm using to learn HTML and CSS. Hopefully this will work out okay :).
					I'm just learning everything as I go. The book I'm using is <i>HTML&CSS Design and Build Websites</i> by Jon Duckett.
