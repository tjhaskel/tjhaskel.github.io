		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p><img src="../images/aboutmepic.jpg" alt="Picture for twitter" width="278" height="400" class=align-left /> Hello! My name is Ally and 
		you may be wondering who I am and why I am on this website. Well, I'm Trevan's super supportive girlfriend and 
		while I was helping him design his website, I decided that I'd like my own page too, like a miniwebsite :). Currently I'm a student at 
		Indiana University School of Optometry getting my Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) degree. I graduated from IUB in 2015 with a B.S. in Neuroscience.
		Hopefully I can share the neat facts that I learn from class on my blog. I also hope to eventually learn more about HTML and 
		CSS to make this website both asthetically pleasing and functional. </p>
